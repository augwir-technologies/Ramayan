/*
* How to use:
* 1- Attach this script to the player, or the parent of your axe
* 2- Make sure that your axe has Rigidbody component on it
* 3- You will have a target which the handler of the axe, or where the axe should be when the player is holding it
* 4- Create an empty game object which should stay attached to the hander (target) and place it next to it. It is the
*    point that gives the curve to your axe returning movement. Keep adjusting it until you find the perfect curve.
